# py-tensorflow
A FreeBSD port for tensor flow.


The package now builds and works but the Makefiles and patches now need to be cleaned up.

## TODO

This is a current work in progress and still some issues which need to be addressed

- [x] Fix the final linking error.

- [ ] Replace some patch with sed commands in Makefile

- [x] Modify the build system to stop building external componants.

- [ ] Add options to set cpu optimisation.
