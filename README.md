# py-tensorflow
A FreeBSD port for tensor flow.


## TODO

This is a current work in progress and still some issues which need to be addressed

- [x] Fix the final linking error.

- [ ] Replace some patch with sed commands in Makefile one the build is successful.

- [ ] Modify the build system to stop building external componants. Might be easiest to tackle one at a time.
